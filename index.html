    <img class="grpelem temp_no_img_src" id="u179-95" alt="Dear Maud, 1/2 year. 1/2 year of laughter. 1/2 year of sadness. 1/2 year of pleasure. 1/2 year of being together. And after all this time we’ve been through a lot, and when I say a lot, I really mean A LOT. But when we were almost there, something in me snapped. I exploded and couldn’t keep up anymore. My grades lowered dramatically, everyone asked what was wrong and I was terribly unhappy. After one month of talking to people, trying to figure stuff out, I found it, the reason, or so I thought. It was you, I was convinced it had to be, my mind sank, I was unbearable, but HAD to make a decision. And so I did. We both know how that turned out. After 2 days of being alone, damaging my ears by listening to music on max and damaging my mind by thinking and thinking without getting anywhere, I figured something out. Never have I stopped looking for a reason in that month, I thought and thought, but couldn’t find anything. Just after I made my decision it had hit me. I was looking in the wrong place. Never was I supposed to be looking for a reason within you, I had to be looking for a reason within me all along. It was me who made me unhappy all along. I was the one who was torturing myself. It slammed me like a slash hammer in the face. I was trying to change. I’m in possession of the bad habit to change to someone’s liking, I’ve always done that, that’s how I make friends, make people to like me, and get better at living. Act like people want you to, and they like you. But it had became such a habit that I did it to everyone. So that includes you…… When you told me you were struggling with your sexuality I tried to feel the same, tried to force myself to feel the same. I forced myself to like your music, Be more artistic, Even to be more negative and dark. I became terribly unhappy, but it had become such a habit that I didn’t think about it, it just happened. This was also where all the talks were about we had, you might not be able to remember it, but if you think back, it was all caused by this urge to be what people wanted me to be. When I wasn’t happy or relieved after we broke up, or whatever we did, I realized it. Too late of course, cause why would I ever be on time? xD I was playing video games because I didn’t have anything else to do, except for learn and like not ruin my future, but I was gaming. And literally what I thought was: “I’m so glad I’m able to do this again, that was something I missed while being with Maud” That’s when it struck me, it wasn’t you that had forbidden me to do that. It was me, I had given up hobbies I really enjoyed doing because I thought ‘that was better, and that was what she wanted’. But that’s not what made me happy, it made me ultimately feel very uncomfortable and sad. It was never you, it was always me, I just didn’t realize it. This is who I am, I’m not writing this, I can’t do that, I’m not creative, I’m creative in my own way, this way. And I don’t know what is going to happen now, but whatever happens, know I really really enjoyed the time we spend together. The stuff we have done together, and the moments we have shared. We walked in the middle of the night back home because we missed the bus. We were very awkward meeting each other parents. We made a personalized wallpaper. I tried to teach you how to roller skate. You tried to teach me to draw better. We both kind of succeeded but not really, lol. We drove a step through the Decathlon. We went to Rotterdam to see a movie. And supported our friend on her musical, when you fucked me over by not making flowers yourself haha, yeah I still hate you for that xD. Thank you for everything -Andy  P.s. if you want to see something funny: https://youtu.be/HLSvY1fKQI4 (Watch it all the way) Done reading? I've made something beforehand, I don't know if you wanna see it, but since I've already made it, I thought I might as well include it.
